  "bitcoin mining": "Why mine bitcoin? To potentially earn bitcoin block rewards (6.25 bitcoins as of April 2023).  To participate in securing and maintaining the decentralized Bitcoin network. Bitcoin miners discover new blocks by competing with each other using specialized computing equipment to generate fixed-length codes known as 'hashes.' Miners must find a hash with an equal or higher number of zeros in front of it than the 'target hash.' They change a 'cryptographic nonce' in the previous block header data to generate different hashes. Mining requires energy-intensive computers, particularly application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners, which can generate trillions of hashes per second.    Bitcoin mining rewards:  For every new block added to the blockchain, miners receive a fixed amount of newly minted coins. Block rewards decrease roughly every four years, or 210,000 blocks, in a process called 'Bitcoin Halving.' The current block reward is 6.25 BTC. Once 21 million BTC is released, miners will only earn rewards in the form of bitcoin transaction fees.  To increase their chances of profit, miners can join 'mining pools,' where they share rewards according to each miner's contribution. However, mining profitability is limited by electricity and hardware costs, especially for miners with limited resources. Bitcoin mining difficulty: The Bitcoin protocol adjusts mining difficulty every two weeks to keep block discovery times as close to 10 minutes as possible. If blocks are discovered too quickly or slowly, the protocol adjusts the target hash, making it harder or easier for miners to find blocks. Bitcoin mining energy consumption: Bitcoin mining consumes vast amounts of energy due to the high computational power required for mining new coins. The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) estimates that Bitcoin consumes approximately 131 TeraWatt hours (TWh) of electricity per year. This high energy consumption is a significant drawback of Bitcoin mining.  Why Proof of Work & ASICs are a good thing - from ASICS & Decentralization FAQ by Poelstra Proof of work (PoW) consensus has thermodynamic limits, creating incentives against centralization due to cooling costs. However, economies of scale in electrical production can encourage centralization. ASICs bring mining closer to thermodynamic limits, benefiting decentralization and reducing environmental impact. ASIC resistance increases algorithmic complexity, leading to manufacturing centralization and slower proof validation, which negatively impacts decentralization. Memory-hardness increases ASIC board footprint and capital costs, encouraging centralization. Scrypt is slower to validate, more complex, and more memory-hard than SHA2, making it less desirable. Primecoin is slower to validate, more complex, and uses an ad-hoc algorithm with no guarantees of being progress-free, approximation-free, or optimization-free. Proof of stake (PoS) aims to consume the cryptocurrency itself for consensus, rather than relying on energy-intensive mining. However, PoS faces the 'nothing at stake' problem, where there is no cost for users to vote on multiple blockchain forks, leading to a tragedy of the commons. This issue is fatal for centralization and consensus in PoS systems. PoS can be useful for creating innovative protocols, but it cannot be used to create distributed consensus. "
